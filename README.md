# Asteroids

Asteroids is a HTML5 canvas-based game that challenges players to navigate through space, avoiding and destroying asteroids. The game blends classic arcade-style gameplay with modern graphics and interactive elements, making it an excellent demonstration of real-time JavaScript game development.

## Project Overview

In Asteroids, players control a rocket that must dodge and shoot down incoming asteroids to survive. The game features a dynamic parallaxing background of stars and planets. The canvas continuously updates with player and asteroid movements, incorporating collision detection and simple physics to animate interactions.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Control a rocket with arrow keys to dodge asteroids and space debris.
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Use spacebar to shoot bullets and destroy asteroids.
- **Interactive Elements**: The game includes interactive buttons for starting and restarting gameplay.
- **Responsive Design**: Canvas adjusts to fit the window size, ensuring the game is playable on various devices and screen sizes.
- **High Scores**: Player scores are tracked and you can see and try to beat other players' high scores.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering game graphics and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implements game logic, collision detection, and controls.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage and enhances the visual appeal of the interface.

## Design and Implementation

The game is structured around a main game loop that updates and redraws the canvas in response to player actions and game mechanics. It utilizes JavaScript classes to manage different game elements like the rocket, asteroids, bullets, and background stars. Collision detection algorithms enhance the gameplay by providing realistic interactions between objects.
